        <h2>The Who &amp; The What</h2>
      	<p>I am the mother of one rescue Rottweiler.  I am semi-retired from a career in Marketing and Travel and recently had my own company that provided website services to VERY small businesses in South Florida.  We provided hosting and limited website development to a variety of clients.  Website development was limited to existing template modification/customization and ongoing content management. There was also a great deal of coaching and counseling for clients not native to the internet space!!</p>
      	<hr>
		<h2>The Why</h2>
		<p>My ultimate goal is to improve my skills and stay current so I can help more folks get their small businesses online.</p>

      	<h2>The Previous Programming Experience</h2>
       	<p>Well, as they say:  Just enough to be dangerous!  I have worked in HTML and CSS.  I made it halfway through a Javascript course; sadly I had to drop out before completion.  Hopefully I can make another run at it in the spring.</p>

        <h2>The platform?</h2>
   <p>I work on a PC. Yippee!</p>
